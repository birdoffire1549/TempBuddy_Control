# TempBuddy Control
This is firmware code for the TempBuddy Control Unit designed by Scott Griffis. This code is currently functional and I have been using on a unit which controls the heat in my shed. This device though it can be operated via Web Browser from a computer or phone, is actually intended to be used in conjunction with the TempBuddy Sensor unit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently the web interface hosted by the device is insecure but I plan on making changed to the code soon to make it more secure. In particular so that Network PSKs and device admin passwords aren't sent around in clear text.

> [!NOTE]
> This README file is a work-in-progress.
